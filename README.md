# Simple-Neural-Net
A neural network coded entirely from scratch
# Summary
An implementation for a basic Neural Network, completely customizable. One can choose the number of layers, the dimension of each layer (including input and output) and whether or not to have bias nodes. It can be trained, in which case the weights are adjusted according to the backpropagation algorithm. After training the network can make predictions based on a feedforward pass of the input.

The file NN.py contains the Neural Network class while testing.py is a simple classification task where we first train a network and then check its accuracy.
